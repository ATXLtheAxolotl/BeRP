# Bedrock Edition Realm Protocol (BeRP)
BeRP is a raknet implementation solution for bedrock edition realms.

Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/9S4aKh684W) for updates!

We also have a [websocket](https://github.com/PMK744/Node-BEWSS) version that uses the /connect command in game!

BeRP works on Bedrock realms, and some external servers. External Servers (that use device auth)/singleplayer worlds are not supported and is not planned to be.

BeRP uses protocol data from another repository. For more info, visit [here](https://github.com/NobUwU/BeRP/tree/main/data/latest).
