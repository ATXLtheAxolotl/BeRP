# Bedrock Edition Realm Protocol (BeRP)
BeRP is a raknet implementation solution for bedrock edition realms.

Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/9S4aKh684W) for updates!
We also have a [websocket](https://github.com/PMK744/Node-BEWSS) version that uses the /connect command in game!

This is a complete mess as development is hard please excuse the mess


Tool will work on all realms and only some servers.
Most servers require the mcauthflow to have an xsts identity with a signed auth title
we are too lazy to make the auth title stuff right now so some servers will block the tool from joining


BeRP is aimed towards realms not servers.
