# Bedrock Edition Realm Protocol (BeRP)
BeRP is a raknet implementation solution for bedrock edition realms.


This is a complete mess as development is hard please excuse the mess


Tool will work on all realms and only some servers.
Most servers require the mcauthflow to have an xsts identity with a signed auth title
we are too lazy to make the auth title stuff right now so some servers will block the tool from joining


If you are trying to do stuff on a server though we suggest you use a tool like [bedrock-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/bedrock-protocol)
as BeRP is aimed towards realms not servers.
