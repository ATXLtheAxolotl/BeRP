# Data Source

BeRP sources it's protocol data from [minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data)

BeRP does not claim any of this data as it's own or takes credit.

Reason why we don't use [minecraft-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-data), is that we only need to use the latest protocol data for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
